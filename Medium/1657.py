# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close
'''
Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters. For example, a b cd e -> a e cd b
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
